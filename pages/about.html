        <h2>Here’s the deal.</h2> I’m Marcus, and I think being a developer is kinda like being a curious
        problem-solver who also happens to enjoy turning code and logic into something real...
        <br><br>I’m a big believer in asking questions, experimenting, and not being afraid to break <br>
        things along the way (as long as I fix them, too). I’m also the one who’ll happily debug at 2 AM with a playlist on repeat,
        and probably celebrate with way too much pizza when it finally works.
        <br><br>
     More than anything, I love seeing ideas click, concepts turn into code, and projects come to life. For me, it’s not just about building software—it’s about enjoying the process, sharing the wins, and learning from the challenges.

     I want to create awesome projects with awesome people, and maybe sneak in a few nerdy jokes while I’m at it.
